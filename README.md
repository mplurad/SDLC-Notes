# Software Development Life Cycle, Agile, and SCRUM

## SDLC
  ### What is SDLC?
  - SDLC is a process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high quality softwar
    - SDLC is governed by an international standard (ISO/IEC 12207)
  - SDLC consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace, and alter or enhance specific software
  ### Models of SDLC
  - Waterfall
    - Divide software development into separate phases
    - One phase must be finished before beginning the next phase
    - Main focus is gathering all requirements at first and then building the product based off of those requirements
    - Product is delivered once it has been completed
    - Does not allow for much revision due to gathering requirements first and designing around that
  - Iterative
    - Start with a simple implementation of just a subset of the requirements and iterate over the remaining features
    - Main focus is clearly defining major features and minor features that may be modified during the development process
  - Agile
